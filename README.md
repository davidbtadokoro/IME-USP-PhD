# David Tadokoro's PhD in Computer Science Monorepo

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to storing all relevant resources produced
during my PhD in Computer Science at the [Institute of Mathematics and
Statistics, University of SÃ£o Paulo (IME-USP)](https://ime.usp.br/).

## Projects of this monorepo

This repository acts as a _monorepo_, i.e., multiple independent projects hosted
in a single repository. The projects in this monorepo can be divided into:

- :clipboard: **LaTeX Projects**: Academic papers, reports, presentations, and
the like.
