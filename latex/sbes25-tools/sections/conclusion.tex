\section{Conclusion}

Kworkflow (kw) automates and streamlines kernel workflows by leveraging existing
solutions fragmented across the Linux ecosystem and presenting a cohesive and
unified CLI to users. The tool abstracts complexity in tasks such as build,
deploy, and patch submission, mitigating bottlenecks in development, and
supporting the long-term sustainability of Linux, while reducing duplication of
efforts and wasted resources by the community. As a hub-like solution, kw is
built to be extensible and modularized, allowing continuous incorporation of
other tools to cover more kernel developers' pain points. Beyond its immediate
utility, kw presents an incredible and robust opportunity for data collection
that can further scientific research in the Linux kernel development model.
